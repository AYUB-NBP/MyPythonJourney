This is what I learned:

Django is a web framework that allows you to makes web applications.

You install it using : 
pip install django

You use the the following command to create a new django website project: 
django-admin startproject 'name_of_project'

A directory is created with that same name that you can rename and another directory under it that also has the same name but should not be renamed.

Let's figure out what the newly created project fils are:

•The outer mysite/ root directory is a container for your project. Its name doesn’t matter to Django; you can rename it to anything you like.
manage.py: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. You can read all the details about manage.py in django-admin and manage.py.

•The inner mysite/ directory is the actual Python package for your project. Its name is the Python package name you’ll need to use to import anything inside it (e.g. mysite.urls).

•mysite/__init__.py: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package. If you’re a Python beginner, read more about packages in the official Python docs.

•mysite/settings.py: Settings/configuration for this Django project. Django settings will tell you all about how settings work.

•mysite/urls.py: The URL declarations for this Django project; a “table of contents” of your Django-powered site. You can read more about URLs in URL dispatcher.

•mysite/asgi.py: An entry-point for ASGI-compatible web servers to serve your project. See How to deploy with ASGI for more details.

•mysite/wsgi.py: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project. See How to deploy with WSGI for more details.

We can run the debugging server with the following command:
python manage.py runserver

To create your first app in django, you cd into the out directory of your newly created project and use this command: python manage.py startapp  'name_of_app'
