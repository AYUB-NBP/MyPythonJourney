    <h1>DJANGO!</h1>
    <div>This is what I learned:

        <p>Django is a web framework that allows you to makes web applications.</p>

        <p>You install it using : <code>pip install django</code></p>


        <p>You use the the following command to create a new django website project:
            <code>django-admin startproject 'name_of_project'</code>
        </p>

        <p>A directory is created with that same name that you can rename and another directory under it that also has
            the
            same name but should not be renamed.</p>

        <p>Let's figure out what the newly created project fils are:
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>The outer mysite/ root directory is a container for your project. Its name doesn’t matter to Django;
                you can
                rename it to anything you like.
                manage.py: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. You
                can read
                all the details about manage.py in django-admin and manage.py.</li>

            <li>The inner mysite/ directory is the actual Python package for your project. Its name is the Python
                package name
                you’ll need to use to import anything inside it (e.g. mysite.urls).</li>

            <li>mysite/__init__.py: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python
                package.
                If you’re a Python beginner, read more about packages in the official Python docs.</li>

            <li>mysite/settings.py: Settings/configuration for this Django project. Django settings will tell you all
                about how
                settings work.</li>

            <li>mysite/urls.py: The URL declarations for this Django project; a “table of contents” of your
                Django-powered
                site. You can read more about URLs in URL dispatcher.</li>

            <li>mysite/asgi.py: An entry-point for ASGI-compatible web servers to serve your project. See How to deploy
                with
                ASGI for more details.</li>

            <li>mysite/wsgi.py: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project. See How to deploy
                with
                WSGI for more details.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We can run the debugging server with the following command:
            <code>python manage.py runserver</code>
        </p>
        <p>To create your first app in django, you cd into the out directory of your newly created project and use this
            command:
            <code>p ython manage.py startapp 'name_of_app'</code>
        </p>
    </div>
</body>
