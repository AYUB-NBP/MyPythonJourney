# mystuff['apple'] -> Get apple's value from dictionary called mystuff.
# mystuff.apple() -> Call apple() Function from mystuff.py module.
# mystuff.tangerine -> Gets the variable tangerine from module mystuff.

# we have a very common pattern in Python: 1. Take a key=value style container.
# 2. Get something out of it by the keyâ€™s name.
# In the case of the dictionary, the key is a string and the syntax is [key]. In the
# case of the module, the key is an identifier, and the syntax is .key. Other than
# that they are nearly the same thing.
